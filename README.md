# miniride

It's a ride share application that basically refers to car-pooling. It is very difficult to commute from one place to other for international students when he/she doesn't have a car. There are many paid transportations but doesn't guarantee the in time ride. With these thoughts in mind, building this application where many students can register to this application and provide rides and request rides.
